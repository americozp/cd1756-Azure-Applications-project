## Analysis
### Availability
#### Virtual Machines (VMs): VMs offer better availability options, but it needs configurations. This includes setting up load balancers, managing failover, and ensuring redundancy.
#### App Services: App Services come with built-in high availability and disaster recovery features. They handle failover and redundancy automatically, which simplifies management.
### Workflow
#### Virtual Machines (VMs): VMs provide full control over the environment, allowing you to install any software and configure the OS as needed.
#### App Services: App Services streamline the deployment process by abstracting the underlying infrastructure. This allows developers to focus on code rather than server management.
### Costs
#### Virtual Machines (VMs): VMs can be cost-effective for certain workloads, especially if you need specific configurations or have long-running processes. However, they require you to manage the underlying infrastructure, which can add to operational costs.
#### App Services: App Services can be more cost-effective for smaller applications and startups because they abstract away infrastructure management. They offer various pricing tiers, and you only pay for what you use.
### Scalability
#### Virtual Machines (VMs): VMs offer manual scalability, meaning you need to manage scaling operations yourself. This can be beneficial for highly customized applications but requires more effort and expertise.
#### App Services: App Services provide automatic scaling, making it easier to handle varying loads without manual intervention.

## Choice and Justification
*Given that App Services are generally more cost-effective for web applications, especially if you don't need extensive custom configurations, automatic scaling makes it easier to handle traffic spikes without manual intervention, there is built-in high availability and disaster recovery features, and that App Services abstract away infrastructure management, allowing us to focus on developing and deploying the application, the best choice for our application is App Services.*

## Assessing App Changes
#### Custom Configurations: If your app requires specific OS configurations, custom software installations, or extensive networking setups, VMs might be more appropriate.
#### Resource-Intensive Workloads: For applications that require high-performance computing or complex databases, VMs could be a better fit due to their flexibility and control.
#### Increased Resource Demands: As your app grows and demands more resources, VMs might become more cost-effective and provide the necessary performance.

*In summary, App Services are the best choice for my CMS app due to their cost efficiency, scalability, availability, and simplified workflow. However, if my app's requirements change significantly, VMs might become the more suitable option.*
